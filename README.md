# Implied Emotion Project

This project aims to better understand the emotional impact of social media posts, particularly focusing on **implied** vs. **explicit** emotional expressions in tweets.

## Project Structure

- `/ipynb/` — Archive of past computational notebooks and experimental work  
- `/utils/` — Current scripts and utility files in active use  
- `/csvs/` — Dataset references (note: actual data is stored locally and not pushed to GitHub)

## Current Focus

We are currently exploring the distinction between **implied** and **explicit** emotions in tweet content, aiming to quantify and compare their emotional signals.
