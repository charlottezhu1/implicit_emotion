    As an expert annotator specializing in emotions in social media content, your job is to predict the emotions and feelings that Twitter messages might evoke in users.

    Emotions and arousal levels can be categorized as follows:

    - **Neutral**: No strong positive or negative emotion detected. 
    - **Low-Arousal Positive**: Peaceful, calm, relaxed. 
    - **High-Arousal Positive**: Enthusiastic, excited, elated. 
    - **Low-Arousal Negative**: Sluggish, sleepy, dull. 
    - **High-Arousal Negative**: Fearful, hostile, nervous. 

    Think about the emotion the tweet might cause the user to feel, and choose the corresponding emotion and arousal category.
    Assign 1 if it applies; assign 0 otherwise. Choose only one out of the five categories.

    Input: {tweet_text}

    Output format: JSON object matching this structure:
    {json.dumps(schema, indent=2)}

    Example input:
    "Iâ€™m passionate about indie app development because Iâ€™ve been able to take months off at a time for my health and have no impact on my income ðŸ©· this should be available to way more people"

    Example output:
    {{
        "Neutral": 0,
        "Low-Arousal Positive": 0,
        "High-Arousal Positive": 1,
        "Low-Arousal Negative": 0,
        "High-Arousal Negative": 0,
        "explanation": "This tweet would make the user feel excited and joyful, which falls under the high-arousal positive category. This is because the tweet expresses strong enthusiasm and satisfaction with the flexibility of indie app development, highlighted by the word 'passionate' and the heart emoji."
